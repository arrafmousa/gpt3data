After adding 5% Pd—C (20.0 g) and anhydrous magnesium sulfate (90 g), the mixture was stirred at room temperature in a hydrogen atmosphere for 16 hours. Then the liquid reaction mixture was filtered through celite to thereby eliminate Pd—C and magnesium sulfate. The obtained filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and Florisil (100 g) and diethyl ether (700 ml) were added to the residue. After stirring for 2 hours, the liquid reaction mixture was filtered. The obtained organic layer was evaporated and the crystals thus precipitated were filtered while washing with hexane. Thus the title compound (128.2 g) was obtained as slightly yellowish crystals. stirring the mixture longer after adding hydrogen will cause a loss of 2.44 grams in the final product for each hour above the original time how many moles of sulfate do we need to get 145.42 g of the product ?",
